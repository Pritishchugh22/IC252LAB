Consider the medical_expenditure.csv dataset attached in this assignment. This dataset contains the average daily expenditure in USD ($) on a medicine named “A” across the United States of America between 2nd January 2011 and 15th April 2015. Table 1 provides a description of different columns in this dataset.

Please answer the questions below. 

    1. Independence
Two events, A and B, are independent if P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B).

Please check whether the following events are independent between 2nd January 2011 and 15th April 2015: 

(A) “Number of males <= 93” and “Average daily expenditure on medicine A <= $504”.
(B) “Number of females <= 131” and “Average daily expenditure on medicine A <= $504”.
(C) “Number in age-group 2” <= 25” and “Average daily expenditure on medicine A > $504”.
(D) “Number in age-group 2” <= 25” and “Average daily expenditure on medicine A > $504”.
(E) “Number in region 5” <= 53” and “Average daily expenditure on medicine A > $504”.
 
    2. Covariance
For a sample, the covariance is defined as the following:


Where:
 – values of the X-variable
 – values of the Y-variable
 – mean (average) of the X-variable
 – mean (average) of the Y-variable
 – number of the data points

Please find the covariance between the following variables between 2nd January 2011 and 15th April 2015:

(A). Nmale and Average daily expenditure.
(B). Nfemales and Average daily expenditure.
(C). Nhp0 and Average daily expenditure.
(D). Nhp1 and Average daily expenditure.
(E). Nicd2 and Average daily expenditure.
(F). [optional] In Python, the numpy library has a cov() function, which could be used to compute the covariance between two variables. Please use the cov() function to verify the covariance computed in (A) to (E) above.

    3. Correlation
The Pearson's correlation coefficient r (named after Karl Pearson) can be used to summarize the strength of a linear relationship between two variables  and . The Pearson's correlation coefficient is defined by the following equation:

 

Where,  is the covariance between variables  and  and  and  are the standard deviations of variables  and , respectively.

The table below shows the interpretation of  values in the range [-1, +1]

Please find the  between the following variables between 2nd January 2011 and 15th April 2015 and categorize the relationship based upon the table above (categories could be None, Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong, and Perfect):

(A). Nmale and Average daily expenditure.
(B). Nfemales and Average daily expenditure.
(C). Nhp0 and Average daily expenditure.
(D). Nhp1 and Average daily expenditure.
(E). Nicd2 and Average daily expenditure.
(F). [optional] In Python, the scipy.stats library has a pearsonr() function, which could be used to compute the correlation between two variables. Please use the pearsonr() function to verify the correlations computed in (A) to (E) above.
